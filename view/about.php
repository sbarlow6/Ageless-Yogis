		<h2>About Mysti</h2>

<i>"Be conscious of your thoughts – they create your reality."</i>

<h3>Backstory</h3>

<p>I was first introduced to yoga in 2007 while managing Fern Life Ayurvedic Center in Issaquah, WA. I already had a background in body work, serving as a massage therapist and human resource manager at Granite Bay Spa & Salon for nearly 6 years. At the time, I was a runner and enjoyed the physicality of working out in a gym. So yoga seemed like a slower "exercise" to me, not yet fully understanding the concepts and philosophies of the practice. But I started going to classes and loved the people I was meeting, quickly making friends who continue to support, challenge and inspire me to this day.</p>

<p>I didn't really develop a "practice" until I started to manage SHAKTI Vinyasa Yoga in Bellevue, WA in 2011. After a year of consistent classes and workshops at SHAKTI, I began to notice a considerable difference in my body and outlook toward life.</p>

<p>That shift has been the greatest benefit of yoga for me personally. It has dramatically improved my conscious thinking, diminishing negative thoughts while giving me a sense of stillness and an acceptance of all that is. As it turns out, yoga wasn't too slow, I was moving too quickly.</p>

<p>Life is much easier when you walk through it in a state of conscious awareness, feeling the interactions in which you take part. With this frame of mind, you can easily find yourself in people and circumstances everywhere you go. That revelation has given me a wealth of new perspectives and ways of looking at life, making me far more effective in general while instilling a sense of self-fulfillment in all I do. Vinyasa has made me happier, more connected to myself and others, and enabled me to identify the things that matter most to me.</p>

<p>With the realization of yoga's impact, I decided to share these life-changing benefits with others. So in 2012 I began one of the hardest journeys of my life: working toward my teacher training certification.</p>

<p> Expect a supportive environment that cultivates holistic growth and wellness through introspection and physical development. Yes, it's a workout. But I'm here to make sure it's also a lot of fun!  </p>

<p>Variety is one of the greatest enjoyments in life. And while I occasionally use carefully selected music in my classes and workshops, I also integrate the healing practices of sound therapy and astrology. A good yoga teacher is in tune to the individual needs and experience of the students who walk into the classroom, and can teach a very powerful class with or without music. This personal touch creates a sense of relationship and community with my student base and continues to deepen the results and make the process highly rewarding for everyone involved.</p>

		<h3>Influences and mentors</h3>

<p>All of my teachers have been so influential. But there are a few who have had a tremendous impact on my teaching style and life as a whole:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Baron Baptiste</b> was my first week-long yoga training and it was a powerful experience. His style and sequencing set the foundation for what I teach in my classes today.</li>
<li><b>Lisa Black,</b> owner of SHAKTI, was also highly influential because she ​saw in me the ability to be a yoga instructor before I knew I wanted to be one myself. Lisa has an amazing ability to train teachers and influence her students to be great people. From her example, I strive to do the same</li>
<li><b>Shiva Rea,</b> M.A. is a yogini firekeeper, sacred activist, innovator in the evolution of prana flow yoga, transformational vinyasa flow integrating the tantric bhakti roots of yoga. For continuing education I studied Shiva's Prana Flow Elemental Vinyasa embodying the power of nature.​</li>
<li><b>Tom Kenyon,</b> my sound teacher, has been extremely significant in my development. He helped me open up to how music can affect an individual and how sound can unlock consciousness and new perspectives.</li>
<li><b>Mata Amritanandamayi</b> is my spiritual guru. More commonly known as Amma, or Mother, she has brought selfless love and kindness to more than 34 million people throughout the world by committing her life to alleviating the pain of the poor and addressing the needs of those who suffer – physically and emotionally. One of India's primary spiritual leaders, Amma teaches me to be more compassionate and that we are here on this planet to share and serve.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Philosophies and texts</h3>

<p>I continuously study texts both modern and ancient to provide my students with the most instructive, complete philosophy available. Among the most important of these are:</p>

<p><b>Patanjali's Yoga Sutra,</b> an ancient text that presents a moral code for yogis to follow and outlines the path towards mystical states of enlightenment known as Samadhi, or union with the divine.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Vedas</b> (meaning knowledge in Sanskrit) are Vedic texts and scriptures of knowledge where Yoga (asana, pranayama and meditation) were first introduced to the world. They are also where we find Ayurveda, Jyotish (Eastern) astrology, mantras, mythological stories and "YOGA". These texts were found in India 1500 BCE. Exactly how they got there is unknown.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced training and certifications</h3>
