		<h2>Release, strengthen and restore.</h2>

<p>Develop your perfect union through Vinyasa and discover the wellness, vitality and self-fulfillment you deserve.</p>

<p>The practice of yoga represents the perfect union of art and discipline. When tailored to your unique needs, goals and physical condition, it can provide connection, healing and a sustainable plan for holistic wellness.</p>

<p>We specialize in the practice of Vinyasa for its ability to quickly and permanently improve your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical and mental performance</li>
<li>Flexibility and strength</li>
<li>Balance and stamina</li>
<li>Focus and inner stillness</li>
</ul>
<p>Vinyasa targets the central nervous system. It unites breath with movement, enabling you to comfortably flow between yoga postures with little to no break in between. The practice also offers one of the deepest forms of relaxation available, restoring your energy and leaving you feeling invigorated.</p>

<p>Our approach builds heat within the body – stretching, strengthening and developing your muscle tone through a combination of asana poses, pranayama breathing, the science of meditation, and the philosophy of self-mastery.</p>

<p>We also integrate the healing practices of sound therapy and astrology into my yoga classes. This unique combination of movement, breathing, music and inspirational language awakens your core energy and instills a deep sense of relaxation, meditation and clarity.</p>
